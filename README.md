# MailhogDateSortFixed
This is just Mailhog 1.0.1 +  fix #166/#313 compiled to sort the emails correctly

# Note:

I have never used GO, GOX, etc. before and I just put in the minor code fix, smashed buttons until I was able to get things to compile, and uploaded the results here for others.

It appears to be working for me on Windows. If it doesn't work for you I'm sorry.

Mailhog is fantastic, but it was unusable without the email dates being sorted...hopefully this helps someone.
